      <h2>The Man and the Serpent</h2>

      <p>A Countryman's son by accident trod upon a Serpent's tail,
      which turned and bit him so that he died.  The father in a rage
      got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.
      So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer's
      cattle and caused him severe loss.  Well, the Farmer thought it
      best to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to
      the mouth of its lair, and said to it: "Let's forget and forgive;
      perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my
      cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that
      we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"</p>

      <p class="conclusion">Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.</p>

      <h2>The Dog and the Shadow</h2>

      <p>It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was
      carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way
      home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.  As he
      crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the
      water beneath.  Thinking it was another dog with another piece of
      meat, he made up his mind to have that also.  <br><br>So he made a snap at
      the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of
      meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.</p>

      <p class="conclusion">Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</p>

      <h2>The Sick <br>Lion</h2>

      <p>A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death
      at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.  The animals, his
      subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more
      helpless.  When they saw him on the point of death they thought to
      themselves: "Now is the time to pay off old grudges."  So the Boar
      came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him
      with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the
      Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail
      to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face.  "This is a double
      death," growled the Lion.</p>

      <p class="conclusion">Only cowards insult dying majesty.</p>
